Grade Calculator
This grade calculator is for the class CISC 3130. It assumes there are 8 practice problems (called homework in the program) each worth 6 points.6 labs each worth 2 points and 2 midterms(exams in the program) each worth 10. the final is worth 20. Any value greater than the max or less than zero will not be counted and the user will be asked to re enter the data. Only negative number accepted is -1 which is used to indicate the student has not complete the remaining assignemnts of that type and program will move on to the next type. The due dates for all assigment is the final exam. This means as long as a student hasnt taken the final the program will tell them how many points is needed to achieve every letter grade better than the total at that point. This projection does not occur after the final has been taken.
the sample output data is for 3 students one who has done all assignments other than the labs. one who has a full mark in allassignments including the final and the final one who has 4 homeworks 2 labs and an exam left to submit.
